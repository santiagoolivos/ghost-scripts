A [recent article](https://consortiumlegal.com/2022/11/15/guatemala-la-validez-de-la-firma-electronica-en-un-pagare-y-su-ejecucion-en-juicio-ejecutivo/) by Melissa Morán at Consortium Legal discusses the use of electronic signatures on promissory notes in Guatemala. Traditionally, promissory notes need to follow certain rules like having the debtor’s name and signature. They also have to include certain phrases to ensure legal enforceability. In Guatemala, these notes can be executed via a streamlined court procedure called "executive action," as long as they comply with existing legal codes.

The article explores whether electronic signatures can legally endorse a promissory note, allowing it to be executed in court if obligations aren't met. The key is Guatemala’s Law for the Recognition of Electronic Communications and Signatures (Decree 47-2008), which accords equal validity to electronic signatures as long as they meet specific conditions. This includes ensuring the signer’s identity and intent are clear, and that the signature is dependable based on the situation.

Advanced electronic signatures, which can be certified by official authorities, carry the same legal weight as handwritten ones. They are admissible in court, provided that electronic signature laws are upheld. While this legal framework is in place, using electronic signatures on notes isn’t yet commonplace. A judge might still question an electronic signature’s validity due to its unique nature. 

Moreover, proving the value and conditions of an electronically signed promissory note in court may require additional evidence, like an expert report showing compliance with the law. This article posits that while there is a legal path for using electronic signatures on promissory notes in Guatemala, it’s an evolving practice that might face practical challenges in the courtroom.
