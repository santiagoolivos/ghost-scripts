A [recent article by Filevine](https://www.filevine.com/blog/legal-document-fonts-style-and-sizing-a-comprehensive-guide/) explores how the seemingly simple choice of legal document fonts can significantly impact how your work is perceived. Choosing the right font style and size enhances the readability and professionalism of legal documents. It ensures that documents are accessible and convey a sense of credibility. The article explains the differences between serif and sans-serif fonts. Serif fonts, like Times New Roman and Georgia, provide a classic and formal look. Sans-serif fonts, such as Arial and Calibri, offer modern and approachable styles that work well on digital screens.

Filevine's article emphasizes the importance of adhering to legal standards and guidelines when selecting fonts for court filings or other legal documents. For instance, the Supreme Court of the United States requires specific fonts, like the Century family, in briefs. Moreover, the article highlights the necessity of using accessible fonts, such as those recommended by the ADA, to ensure that legal documents are readable for everyone, including individuals with visual impairments.

The article also sheds light on leveraging technology to maintain consistent font usage across legal documents. Document automation tools, like those provided by Filevine, enable the creation of templates with pre-set fonts and formatting styles. This ensures consistency, saves time, and reduces errors in legal document production.

In summary, choosing the right font involves balancing aesthetics, readability, and compliance. By mastering font selection, legal professionals can enhance their documents' impact, professionalism, and accessibility. This article by Filevine reassures that making thoughtful font choices is both essential and feasible with today's technology, ultimately supporting better client service and effective communication.
