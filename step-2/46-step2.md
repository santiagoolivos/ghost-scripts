A [recent article by Haldanes Solicitors and Notaries](https://www.lexology.com/library/document?tk=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3NDEwMzc3MTYsImRhdGEiOnsiRG9jdW1lbnRHdWlkIjoiMzM2MTM3NTEtYTA4MS00OTJhLWIzNDAtZWQyYjg3MjZlNzIxIiwiQ29udGFjdEd1aWQiOiIwMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAiLCJCeXBhc3NMb2dpbiIsIzPdeWVBgkmlpbiIHiiaWXytBolkxy3ModYJ0Vtue6TNsuKTZTFRFSKp) explores how electronic signatures, or e-signatures, are becoming more common in Hong Kong, especially as more people work from home. In Hong Kong, the Electronic Transactions Ordinance (Cap. 553), or ETO, governs e-signatures. This law defines e-signatures broadly, including digital symbols or marks attached to electronic records to approve or authenticate them.

For business contracts not involving the government, e-signatures are usually valid, provided certain criteria under the ETO are met. These include ensuring the e-signature process is reliable for the intended purpose, and the recipient must agree to the use of an e-signature. Various platforms like DocuSign and Adobe Sign have made signing documents easier and have replaced the older method of scanning physical signatures into PDFs.

However, when dealing with government-related contracts, digital signatures must come from a recognized digital certificate issued by an authority approved under the ETO. Not every document can use e-signatures; there are exceptions like wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and certain property-related documents, which must have traditional ink signatures.

The article stresses the importance of checking that e-signatures are allowed for a specific contract under the ETO and ensuring they are secure. This shift towards digital transactions presents exciting possibilities for how legal agreements are handled in Hong Kong, offering a more flexible approach for individuals and businesses alike.
