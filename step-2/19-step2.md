[A recent article by Moroğlu Arseven](https://www.morogluarseven.com/news-and-publications/category/publications/ma-gazette/ma-gazette-edition-124-1-march-2023/) discusses an important change in Turkey regarding electronic signatures. The new rule extends the life of certain algorithms used in creating and verifying digital signatures. This change, made official on December 28, 2022, will now keep these algorithms valid until December 31, 2025. This extension aims to ensure ongoing security and reliability for electronic transactions in the country.

According to the rule, defined in the first paragraph of Article 6 of the Communiqué on Processes and Technical Criteria Regarding Electronic Signature, digital signatures must follow specific standards. For example, the signature creation data for users needs to be at a secure level, such as 2048 bits for RSA or at least 256 bits for DSA Elliptic Curve. These standards are crucial because they protect personal information during electronic transactions.

The new update maintains high security by adhering to known algorithms like SHA2 and SHA3, which help summarize and verify signature data. These updates reflect the advances in technology, ensuring that digital transactions remain secure.

The Chairman of the Information and Communication Technologies Board will oversee the enforcement of these rules. This board plays a key role in regulating and promoting safe electronic communication in Turkey.

Overall, this update shows Turkey's commitment to strong digital security practices. By aligning with trusted global standards, Turkey is ensuring that its electronic signature system remains robust and secure. This decision by Moroğlu Arseven highlights the country's focus on future technological developments, promising a secure and reliable environment for digital transactions.
