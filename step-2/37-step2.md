A [recent article by Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP](https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2021/12/irs-extends-temporary-use-of-electronic-or-digital-signatures-until-2023) shares good news about the use of electronic or digital signatures for tax documents. The IRS has extended its temporary policy allowing electronic signatures on many tax forms until October 31, 2023. This change continues to reduce the need for paper filing and in-person interactions, making tax filing easier and safer, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

The IRS first adopted this policy in August 2020 and has renewed it multiple times due to its success. Importantly, the policy does not require any specific technology for creating digital or electronic signatures. As a result, it permits both scanned images of handwritten signatures and digitally encrypted signatures. The article explains that this flexibility supports diverse technologies and makes it more convenient for taxpayers.

Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP highlights that the list of forms eligible for electronic signatures has grown. Newly added is Form 1042, which deals with annual tax returns for U.S. source income of foreign persons. Other forms like Form 8832 for entity classification and IRC Section 83(b) election statements also remain eligible. This broad list shows the IRS's commitment to making digital filing more accessible.

However, the article mentions a note of caution. The policy might change after October 31, 2023, so taxpayers should stay informed. For now, though, the extension is a positive step toward modernizing tax filing, making it more efficient and user-friendly.

The adaptability and foresight of the IRS during these times continue to help taxpayers file their taxes with ease. The initiative contributes to a smarter, more responsive tax system that meets today's digital demands.
