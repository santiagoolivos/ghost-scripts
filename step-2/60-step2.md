A [recent article by CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro Olswang LLP](https://cms-lawnow.com/en/ealerts/2024/12/romania-amends-companies-law-to-digitalise-shareholders-meetings?utm_source=lawnow-realtime&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Romania%20amends%20Companies%20Law%20to%20digitalise%20shareholders%e2%80%99%20meetings&utm_id=4379&utm_term=read_more&utm_content=702494) discusses how Romania's new Law 299/2024 is transforming company operations by embracing digital tools. The law aims to modernize the Romanian Companies Law 31/1990, making it easier for businesses to manage shareholder meetings and cut down on paperwork. 

One of the most notable changes is allowing shareholders to vote online during their meetings. Whether shareholders attend in person or connect remotely, they can cast their votes electronically. This change encourages wider participation, especially from minority shareholders, and maintains a transparent voting process. The use of electronic signatures to authenticate decisions further streamlines the process.

Besides enhancing voting flexibility, the new law removes the obligation for companies to disclose beneficiary details in their foundation documents. This simplification protects personal data and addresses challenges faced by joint-stock companies in updating such information swiftly.

Additionally, Romanian companies now have the option to delegate authority for opening or closing secondary offices to their boards, removing this duty from shareholder meetings. This approach speeds up operational decisions and lightens the load on shareholders.

Finally, the board of directors can now amend meeting announcements as needed. They must ensure these changes are publicized at least ten days before meetings, allowing for timely adjustments without causing disruption.

These updates represent a significant step in aligning Romanian business practices with modern needs. By accommodating electronic means and reducing bureaucratic requirements, Romania is creating a more appealing environment for investment and business growth.
