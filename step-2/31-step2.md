A [recent article by Paul Hastings LLP](https://www.paulhastings.com/insights/client-alerts/japans-twilight-of-wet-signatures-and-chops-contract-practice-moves-towards) highlights a significant shift in Japan's contract practices, moving from traditional wet ink signatures and seal impressions towards electronic signatures (e-signatures). For over a century, Japanese agreements have relied on seals to validate signatures, as it's difficult to forge these marks. However, the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of remote work have accelerated the need for digital solutions. Many employees found it challenging to physically access offices just to attach these seals, highlighting the necessity for change.

Japan's shift towards e-signatures isn't completely new. The country had already laid the groundwork with the Act on Electronic Signatures and Certification Business, enacted back in 2010. Despite this, e-signatures didn't gain much traction until recent years, largely due to practical challenges like needing to partner with e-signature vendors for certification.

Under this law, for an e-signature to hold similar legal weight as a wet signature, it must meet specific requirements. These include showing proof the signer created the document, ensuring no alterations were made post-signature, and having robust encryption management. The Japanese government clarified that if these conditions are met, the document is legally valid, much like its paper counterpart.

Today, many e-signature service providers have adjusted their practices to ensure a secure and verifiable signing process. This includes using two-factor authentication to confirm a user's identity. As Japan continues to modernize its legal processes, e-signatures offer a more efficient and accessible way to conduct business, paving the way for greater digital adoption across the country. This transition marks a positive step toward more convenient and globally synced business practices, making the process simpler for all involved.
