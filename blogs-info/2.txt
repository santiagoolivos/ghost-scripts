Introduction

The Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA) of Thailand has issued Guidelines for Conducting Electronic Transactions or Contracts under the Electronic Transactions law. These guidelines aim to facilitate the practical application of technology and electronic transaction laws in everyday dealings while establishing a standardized framework for e-transactions and e-contracts (collectively referred to as e-Contracts).

Key Phases of e-Contract Management

The Guidelines outline standards for three main phases of e-Contract management:

Creation of the e-Contract
Maintenance of the e-Contract
Conversion between e-Contract and printout
Phase 1: Creation of the e-Contract

1.1 Drafting: e-Contracts can be created using any available means, provided they remain accessible and usable in the future without its meaning being altered. Common applications include Microsoft Word and Google Docs.

1.2 Electronic Signature: It must identify the signatory and indicate approval of information contained therein. Valid methods include trustworthy digital signatures and digital identification data (e.g., ThaiID application).

1.3 Electronic Seal: Similar to electronic signatures, it must identify the seal owner and indicate approval of information contained therein. Options include embedding a seal image or using identification certificates.

1.4 Finalization: To ensure admissibility as evidence, the e-Contract’s originality must be provable from creation to completion, often using digital signatures, electronic timestamps, or electronic seals.

1.5 Stamp Duty: For contracts requiring stamp duty, electronic payment through the Revenue Department is allowed, with the reference number and receipt annexed to the e-Contract.

Phase 2: Maintenance of e-Contract

2.1 The e-Contract must remain accessible and unaltered in content (changes to fonts or formatting are acceptable if they do not affect the content).

2.2 An event log must be maintained, recording the origin, recipient, date, and time of sending or receiving the e-Contract.

Phase 3: Conversion Between e-Contract and Printout

3.1 Printout to e-Contract: Content and format must remain unaltered, using ETDA-approved technologies. The converter’s identity must be recorded.

3.2 e-Contract to Printout: This must be printed from the original e-Contract and reviewed for complete accuracy.

Key Takeaways

The ETDA Guidelines provide a comprehensive framework for creating, maintaining, and converting e-Contracts in Thailand.
Electronic signatures and seals must be capable of identifying the signatory/sealer and indicating their approval of the information contained therein.
The originality and integrity of e-Contracts must be maintained throughout their lifecycle to ensure legal admissibility.
Stamp duty can be paid electronically and attached to the e-Contract.
Conversion between electronic and physical formats must preserve the content and, in most cases, the formatting of the original document.
These guidelines promote the use of technology in everyday transactions while ensuring the security and legal validity of e-Contracts.
As technology evolves, adherence to these guidelines will become increasingly important for businesses and individuals engaging in electronic transactions.
