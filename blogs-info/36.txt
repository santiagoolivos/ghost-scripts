THE LAW FIRM OF CENTRAL AMERICA

The COVID 19 pandemic accelerated many of the changes that were already being implemented worldwide, especially those related to the implementation of technology to documents and contracts. In this sense, during the year 2021, El Salvador has worked so that the electronic signature, regulated since 2015, begins to be operational and used in the ordinary course of business and public administration, for which, El Salvador already counts with a certifying entity of electronic signature and seals duly authorized by the Ministry of Economy and the Electronic Signature Unit in El Salvador.

That said, it is important to know the scope of an electronic signature in El Salvador and, more importantly, what is its legal and probative value. In this regard, the Electronic Signature Law (ESL) establishes the following types of electronic signatures, namely:

Simple electronic signature, which can be any form of consent that allows the subscriber to be identified and their consent to the message in which it is posted.
Certified electronic signature, in which it is possible to detect any subsequent modification of the document in which the signature is attached, and which is provided by an authorized local certifying entity.
Electronic seal: electronic data generated by a secure creation system, which, when included in an electronic document, guarantees the origin and integrity of the document, as well as its provenance.
Article 8 of the Electronic Signature Law establishes that data messages and electronic documents will have the legal effectiveness that corresponds to their respective nature, and that, if they are filed within the framework of an administrative procedure or judicial process and they will be used enforced as proof, they will be treated as exhibit, according to the following detail:

The public documents signed with an electronic signature and the private documents granted with a certified electronic signature or authorized electronic seal (which are considered reliable private documents), will constitute proof of the facts, acts or state of matters that they document; of the date and persons involved in it, as well as the functionary or official who issues it, in accordance with the Civil and Commercial Procedure Code.
Private documents signed with a simple electronic signature or electronic seal that do not comply with the regulations of the ESL, will be valued as evidence in an administrative procedure or judicial process, if their authenticity has not been contested or it has been demonstrated. In case their authenticity has not been proven, the law establishes that the judge will appreciate these documents in accordance with the rules of sound criticism.
Beyond the previously detailed legal content, it will be the courts and applicants of justice who will define the scope of the legal provisions described above, for which, it will take a few years and controversies to arise for the jurisprudence to be known in relation to this type of execution that to this date is novel, but useful and that fulfills the purpose of expediting the issuance of documents, both in the public and private spheres.
