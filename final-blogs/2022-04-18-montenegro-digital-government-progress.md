A [recent article](https://www.lexology.com/library/document?tk=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3NDEwMzc0MzYsImRhdGEiOnsiRG9jdW1lbnRHdWlkIjoiMjE2NWI4NzEtZjZkZC00MzIxLTliODktODAxOTA4ZjAwM2M1IiwiQ29udGFjdEd1aWQiOiIwMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAiLCJCeXBhc3NMb2dpbiIsdHJ1ZX19.yg_xTIP67qnQbPNdBlCGJ9Rp03tlgNZwYDCoZoHi1jECuRA2FCf4tLCvMCw6AITeUWidgu6KitTY6yt1cDSuhQ) by JPM & Partners highlights Montenegro's exciting progress on digital government services. The Montenegrin government recently introduced a Bill of the Law on Electronic Document. This proposed law, pending approval by Montenegro's Parliament, aims to update the digital practices of government administration, as shown during the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. The goal is to improve how public services create, use, and store electronic documents.

The Bill brings Montenegro in line with its current Law on Electronic Identification and Signature (LEIS). It expands the definition of electronic signatures to include simple and qualified electronic signatures while introducing an electronic stamp for documents. Electronic documents will be considered originals if signed with these signatures or stamps and will hold the same legal strength as paper documents.

Among the fresh ideas, the Bill outlines what digitalization means: turning non-electronic documents into digital ones that machines can read and save for the long run. Certified digitalized documents will also carry the same legal weight as their paper counterparts.

Another key aspect of the Bill is the process of digital certification. Normally, notaries and certain authorities certify documents, but the new Bill suggests that other public bodies might also handle digital certifications. This could make processes easier and more accessible.

Moreover, there is a promise of more convenient electronic payments for administrative fees soon, as mentioned by Montenegro's Ministry of Public Administration, Digital Society, and Media. Montenegro is taking steady steps toward modern and efficient digital government services. This new Bill, with some tweaks in Parliament, should assist Montenegro in using digital tools in both governmental and private arenas effectively.
