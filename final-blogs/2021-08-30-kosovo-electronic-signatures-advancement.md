A [recent article by Boga & Associates](https://www.lexology.com/library/document?tk=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3NDEwMzc1NzMsImRhdGEiOnsiRG9jdW1lbnRHdWlkIjoiYWFiOGIzYmEtNWE2ZC00M2I0LWIwOGUtZjYwNDI1ODNhMWM3IiwiQ29udGFjdEd1aWQiOiIwMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAiLCJCeXBhc3NMb2dpbiI6dHJ1ZX19.j5iUfu8b13eemixgDXvmtH6MNBpYZGjHrjYXl8salKwlc8Q1bly-BZ_5lFd0cbo4xuwga9Pq5CNqj21z1Fa-RA) highlights Kosovo's new Draft Law on Electronic Identification and Trust Services in Electronic Transactions. This law aims to modernize the legal framework for electronic signatures and other digital verification methods. The law, once in effect, will remove outdated rules, aligning with the EU's Regulation on Electronic Identification and Trusted Services for Electronic Transactions.

The Draft Law clearly defines terms like simple, advanced, and qualified electronic signatures, setting standards to ensure their validity. A qualified electronic signature, backed by a qualified certificate, will hold the same legal weight as a handwritten signature. This development promises to simplify digital transactions, making them more secure and legally binding.

In addition to electronic signatures, the law covers electronic seals and website authentication. An electronic seal will guarantee the origin and integrity of documents, while website authentication will verify the authenticity and reliability of a site. The Electronic Registered Delivery Service will provide a secure and verifiable way to exchange data online, reducing the need for physical meetings and documentation.

Trust Service Providers, who facilitate these services, must meet specific security requirements. Qualified providers must employ trusted staff and use technology to guard against data misuse. This ensures that digital processes remain robust and safe.

The law acknowledges scenarios where electronic signatures can't replace traditional methods. For example, family law cases and property-related legal actions will stick with conventional approaches due to their complexity.

Overall, this initiative marks a positive step towards digital advancement in Kosovo, promising a future where electronic and traditional methods coexist harmoniously. The draft law sits as a robust framework catering to the increasing demand for digital transactions, fostering trust and efficiency in Kosovo's digital landscape.
