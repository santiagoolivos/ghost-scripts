A [recent article](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a8d713c1-5cb2-4bf8-8d40-63dbcb60c32f) by Bird & Bird delves into the practical aspects of using qualified electronic signatures (QES) in Poland. This method of signing documents electronically has been around for over 20 years but is only now becoming widely used. According to the Civil Code, documents signed with a QES are legally equal to documents signed by hand.

Qualified electronic signatures offer advanced features not present in physical signatures. For instance, they allow clear identification of the signer and protect the integrity of the document. This means that any changes to the document after signing are easy to detect. Moreover, using a QES allows you to create many "original" copies of a signed document. You can also include a signature's context, such as approval or endorsement, which enhances its functionality beyond a simple signature.

There are some technical points to pay attention to when using QES. All parties must have a qualified certificate from an authorized provider. If any signers do not have a QES, it is possible to acquire one through video verification instead of in-person. Additionally, it's important to properly verify QES signatures to ensure they meet the necessary legal standards. This can be done using specific software or services that confirm a signature's qualifications.

QES can be highly beneficial because it addresses many drawbacks of traditional handwritten signatures. It helps avoid issues like illegibility, identity verification difficulties, and uncertainty concerning the signature's date. Transitioning to electronic signatures facilitates managing digital documents and communication ease.

In conclusion, Bird & Bird highlights that technologies for qualified electronic signatures are constantly improving, making their use more straightforward and less technologically demanding. Keeping up-to-date with these advancements is vital to maximize the benefits of using electronic signatures in legal processes.
