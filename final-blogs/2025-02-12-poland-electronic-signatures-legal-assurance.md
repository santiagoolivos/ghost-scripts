A [recent article by Schoenherr](https://www.schoenherr.eu/content/everyday-use-of-electronic-documents-in-poland) explores the evolving landscape of electronic document use in Poland. With technology rapidly advancing, electronic signatures are becoming more popular. The Polish Civil Code recognizes three types of legal documents: written, electronic, and document. If an electronic document is signed with a Qualified Electronic Signature (QES), it holds the same weight as a written one. 

QES is a digital signature recognized in Poland and must come from a trust service provider in an EU Member State. This makes everyday business easier by simplifying document handling. While many common electronic signature solutions like DocuSign, AdobeSign, or eSignly are popular, they usually don't include a QES and so can't replace written documents.

In addition, Poland uses a trusted signature called "Podpis Zaufany" for government-related activities. It confirms identity and allows document signing but doesn't meet QES standards. Documents signed this way are valid if the law or parties involved agree. If not, they aren't equivalent to written documents.

Each EU Member State keeps a list of certified trust service providers. In Poland, the National Bank of Poland manages this through the National Certification Centre. The European Commission compiles this information and makes it available on the eIDAS Dashboard. This helps ensure a signature is a QES, offering legal security.

The positive move toward electronic signatures in Poland shows the benefits of modern technology, making documentation more accessible and legally binding when using QES. This makes business transactions smoother and adds confidence in digital document handling.
