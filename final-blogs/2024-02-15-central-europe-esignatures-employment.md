A [recent article by Deloitte Legal](https://www.deloitte.com/ce/en/services/consulting/perspectives/transitioning-to-eSignatures-for-employment-documents-in-ce.html) explores how electronic signatures (eSignatures) are transforming employment documents in Central Europe. With more people working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of 'workcations,' companies face challenges coordinating physical document signing. eSignatures offer a convenient solution by allowing documents to be signed digitally, no matter where the employees are located.

This move towards digital transformation aligns with corporate sustainability goals, or ESG strategies, which emphasize reducing paper use. Multinational companies find it easier to incorporate digital solutions into their workflows, leading to paperless operations. Adopting eSignatures helps save time on contract signings and reduces the costs associated with storing physical documents.

For digital HR processes to work, a legal framework must support electronic signing. Central European countries are updating their laws to accommodate this shift. The article clarifies the specific legal requirements necessary to validate eSignatures. It explains three key types: simple electronic signature (SES), advanced electronic signature (AES), and qualified electronic signature (QES).

Additionally, the article addresses how legal systems handle the delivery and archiving of eSigned documents. Some national laws permit electronic delivery of employment documents, which streamlines HR operations. Understanding these requirements is crucial for companies to ensure compliance as they transition to digital HR processes.

Overall, the article highlights the exciting potential of eSignatures in making HR more efficient and aligned with modern work practices. This transformation offers numerous benefits and positions businesses to operate more effectively in a digital world.
