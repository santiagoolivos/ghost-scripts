A [recent article by Bradley Arant Boult Cummings LLP](https://www.lexology.com/library/document?tk=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3NDEwMzc3NTcsImRhdGEiOnsiRG9jdW1lbnRHdWlkIjoiMGU0ZTE3MDEtYjNhZi00ZGM0LWEzNDEtNDU1MTJiZDIwOWJmIiwiQ29udGFjdEd1aWQiOiIwMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAiLCJCeXBhc3NMb2dpbiI6dHJ1ZX19.U0rslELSUHurnCkqqDXBZB4Xx2sMkq8SoGRrw80nh_aQAP-FzS1cUt4qsbxc-Hz-2hgM7tW_vOEikJ3AtaNEZA) takes a closer look at the E-Sign Act, introduced over twenty years ago, and questions if some of its requirements have become outdated. Back when the E-Sign Act was enacted, electronic notifications were a new concept, and devices often struggled with viewing or storing them. Today, these issues are basically history, thanks to advances in technology.

The article discusses the "reasonable demonstration" requirement of the E-Sign Act, which made sure consumers could access electronic notices. Originally, this meant customers had to prove they could receive an email or another type of digital message. Although this made sense years ago, it's now often seen as weakening the overall user experience with little consumer benefit. Almost all modern devices can easily display standard notice formats.

Changes in technology have led many companies to favor a more streamlined approach known as "self-demonstrating consent." This means that when customers use online platforms to consent, they automatically show they can access these digital notices by completing forms or applications online. This practice is more popular now as it lessens the need for additional, confusing compliance tasks. For example, financial institutions now commonly ask consumers to log in to review notices directly on their websites.

Recent actions reflect the trend towards simplifying this process. Notably, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) suggested doing away with these old requirements, acknowledging that they may no longer be needed. Until the laws are updated, self-demonstrating consent offers an efficient and consumer-friendly option for handling electronic notices.

In summary, as technology and user behaviors have evolved, there is a growing call to update the E-Sign Act to make it simpler and more aligned with current consumer needs.
