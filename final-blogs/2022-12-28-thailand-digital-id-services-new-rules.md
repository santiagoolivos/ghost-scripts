A [recent article by Chandler Mori Hamada Limited](https://chandler.morihamada.com/en/insights/newsletters/2022-116) highlights Thailand's new Royal Decree on Supervision of Digital Identification Services, part of the Electronic Transaction Act (B.E. 2544). This law, effective from June 21, 2023, requires digital identification service providers to have an operating license. It marks a significant shift aimed at regulating services like identity proofing, authenticator management, and authentication.

Providers must apply for licenses through Thailand's Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA) and submit thorough plans covering risk management, data protection, anti-corruption, IT security, and customer protection. Existing providers have a 90-day window from the effective date to comply with these new rules.

After obtaining the necessary licenses, companies need to present ETDA with a readiness assessment report confirming their technological and staff preparedness for business operations. The license also comes with responsibilities, such as reporting third-party data management, business modifications, and customer complaints. Licensees must also ensure data storage compliance and deliver an annual report to ETDA.

There are exemptions from the licensing requirements for services supporting electronic signatures and certain internal management services. Failure to comply can result in the suspension or cancellation of licenses, and even criminal penalties for the managing personnel.

These developments suggest positive changes in managing digital identification services in Thailand. The anticipated guidelines and detailed plans reflect a commitment to strengthening data security and integrity. 

Overall, the Royal Decree aims to enhance trust and confidence in digital transactions, offering a promising outlook for both service providers and users in Thailand's digital ecosystem.
