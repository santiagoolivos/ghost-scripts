A [recent article by WH Partners](https://whpartners.eu/news/electronic-signatures-can-they-be-used-to-sign-agreements/) covers the importance and use of electronic signatures in the European Union. The EU has implemented eIDAS Regulation (EU) 910/2014 to standardize electronic signatures across member states. The regulation defines three types: simple, advanced, and qualified, each offering different security levels.

The simple electronic signature is basic, like a digital signature used by a postman. It's not highly secure but works for low-risk situations. The advanced e-signature provides medium-level security and is suited for more significant transactions. It must uniquely link to the signer, protect the document, and ensure it canâ€™t be changed post-signing. The qualified electronic signature is the most secure and is equivalent to a handwritten signature, involving a strict authentication process via a qualified digital certificate.

In Malta, electronic signatures are regulated by the E-Commerce Act, aligning with eIDAS standards. Both advanced and qualified e-signatures have legal standing, similar to traditional contracts. Popular programs like DocuSign and HelloSign facilitate these electronic signatures' use for concluding agreements. However, not all documents can be signed electronically in Malta. For example, contracts related to property rights, wills, or court procedures require traditional signatures.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the acceptance of e-signatures has increased, with the Malta Business Registry allowing qualified e-signatures for document submissions, complying with the eIDAS and the Companies Act. This shift toward electronic solutions represents a notable change in how business transactions are conducted, pointing towards a more digital future in Malta and across the EU.
