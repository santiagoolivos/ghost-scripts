A [recent article by Philip Lee](https://www.lexology.com/library/document?tk=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3NDEwMzc0MTUsImRhdGEiOnsiRG9jdW1lbnRHdWlkIjoiMDI3MjdkZmEtOWI5My00MTBlLWJiZTctZTU0ZjJlYmFlNmFjIiwiQ29udGFjdEd1aWQiOiIwMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAiLCJCeXBhc3NMb2dpbiI6dHJ1ZX19.ihHK-qHwmXaELP-5MD_LdGIGEbSXTNbsYTczFI8K5qznJnkNWLrTM2mAFMh1kW57zPfvpyXoCB346vPsq4PGlg) discusses how new e-signature regulations in Ireland are making it easier to handle real estate transactions. The 2022 Regulations aim to speed up property deals by allowing electronic signatures on most documents. These regulations update the Electronic Commerce Act 2000, especially Sections 12 to 23, to permit e-signatures in many cases.

There are two main kinds of e-signatures used in Ireland. The simple electronic signature is the most common. It can be as easy as typing your name, using a touch screen, scanning a traditional signature, or using tools like DocuSign. The advanced electronic signature is more secure, linking the signer's identity through encryption or passwords.

Although e-signatures are now widely accepted, there are limits. They cannot be used for documents that create a legal interest in property or require registration with the Property Registration Authority (PRA). For example, contracts can use e-signatures, but deeds of transfer, which need PRA registration, cannot.

Much depends on the PRA, which decides if e-signatures can be used for all real estate documents. Even though the 2022 Regulations are active, the full path to fully digital property transactions in Ireland isn't mapped out until the PRA gives more guidance.

This change shows a positive trend towards digital solutions, making real estate deals faster and potentially less stressful in the future.
