A [recent article by BLawyers Vietnam](https://www.blawyersvn.com/digital-signatures-in-signing-labor-contracts/) explains how digital signatures are transforming the way labor contracts are signed in Vietnam. Traditionally, signing these contracts involved paperwork and physical presence, but digital signatures change this. They allow contracts to be signed anytime and from anywhere, reducing costs and hassle associated with printing and papers.

Vietnam's Labor Code 2019 allows labor contracts to be in digital form, just like written ones. An electronic labor contract is basically an agreement between employer and employee, signed electronically. This digital signing can involve different forms like signatures made with numbers, letters, or symbols. Employers can comfortably use digital signatures for these contracts, and it's crucial to understand their legal standing.

Digital signatures must meet certain requirements to be valid. They rely on digital certificates that are confirmed with a public key. The person signing uses a private key that matches the public one, ensuring the signature is authentic. It's also important for this private key to remain securely under the signer's control.

Both employers and employees have duties when using digital signatures. Employers must keep their signature data safe and notify necessary parties if there's an issue. They must ensure all information remains accurate. Employees should verify the signature's reliability and check any digital certificate's legality.

As electronic labor contracts become more common in Vietnam, digital signatures offer a practical solution when traditional signing isn't feasible. By understanding their obligations, both parties in the labor contracts can ensure the agreements' validity, making the process smoother and more modern.
