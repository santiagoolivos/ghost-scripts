A [recent article by Venture North Law](https://vietnam-business-law.info/blog/2024/3/2/e-signatures-of-individuals-under-the-law-on-e-transaction-2023) highlights the changes in Vietnam's new e-signature regulations. The Law on E-Transactions 2023 (LET 2023) alters how individuals use electronic signatures. Previously, individuals could create and use their own e-signatures. Now, the LET 2023 limits this ability by introducing three distinct types of e-signatures, none allowing self-generated signatures by individuals. 

Under the LET 2023, people must use a public digital signature issued by a certified service when engaging in e-transactions. This law aims to enhance secure electronic interactions but also limits personal choice for creating signatures. For organizations, there are specialized types of e-signatures intended for private operations or official use, each backed by secure e-certificates from qualified service providers.

The article also discusses some ambiguity in the LET 2023 regarding individual use of specialized e-signatures. Though originally intended for organizations, certain provisions suggest that organizations can generate and provide specialized e-signatures to individuals within the system. This could open opportunities for e-commerce platforms to empower users with e-signatures for transactions.

Additionally, some verification methods like One-Time Passwords (OTP), SMS, and scanned signatures are not considered e-signatures under the new law. However, these methods can still serve as alternative verification means in e-transactions, if laws permit.

Overall, while the LET 2023 aims to standardize and secure the use of e-signatures, it limits how individuals can independently create and use them, fostering reliance on third-party issued solutions. Despite this restriction, there's optimism that the change may drive growth in digital services as organizations step up to fill the gap with robust e-signature offerings.
