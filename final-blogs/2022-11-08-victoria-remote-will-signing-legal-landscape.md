In a [recent article by Moores](https://www.moores.com.au/electronic-signing-of-wills-is-the-new-legislation-workable/), they discuss the new law in Victoria, Australia, that allows people to sign Wills electronically. This change was initially made during the COVID-19 pandemic and became permanent in 2021 with amendments to the Wills Act 1997 (Vic). The law now includes something called a "remote execution procedure," which allows people to sign a Will using electronic signatures with certain conditions.

The process requires two witnesses to be present, and they can be connected via video call. At least one person must be a lawyer or a similar professional. Both the person making the Will (the Willmaker) and the witnesses need to see each other's signatures being made, which can complicate things if people aren't tech-savvy.

An important case, Re Curtis [2022] VSC 621, showed some of the challenges with these new rules. Mr. Curtis, who made his Will during a COVID lockdown, couldn't meet his lawyer in person. He used a program called Docusign to electronically sign his Will with witnesses attending via Zoom. The Court found issues because the witnesses couldn't see his hands operating the signing device, nor could he see the witnesses sign.

The Court allowed the Will as an "informal Will," meaning it was clear Mr. Curtis wanted it to be his final Will, but it wasn't signed perfectly according to the new procedure. This decision shows the changes are still complicated.

Using remote execution can be hard for elderly people or those not good with technology. They need to use two devices: one to sign and another to record the signing process. Plus, Wills signed this way may face extra scrutiny in court to ensure they truly represent the Willmaker's desires.

Despite these challenges, Moores sees potential in this new flexibility for people living far away or in isolation, and hopes the law will improve to make electronic signing easier for everyone.
