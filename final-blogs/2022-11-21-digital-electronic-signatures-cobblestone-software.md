A [recent article by CobbleStone Software](https://www.lexology.com/library/document?tk=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3NDEwMzcwNzIsImRhdGEiOnsiRG9jdW1lbnRHdWlkIjoiNjBhYTlhZmYtMzMyMS00YjQ5LThiOGMtYWJlNmM5MjZjNzgwIiwiQ29udGFjdEd1aWQiOiIwMDAwMDAwMC0wMDAwLTAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDAwMDAwMDAwMDAiLCJCeXBhc3NMb2dpbiI6dHJ1ZX19.q6Ij6og8Jhlljvu2VZpGnwwFL2CID6AYSdx1rFU0MIis_cZebW_-A4zFBMc-ioiV8a3CgiQtodO7lHaPHdiooA) explains the differences between digital and electronic signatures, emphasizing how they can transform legal operations. Electronic signatures, often known as eSignatures, make signing agreements or contracts online simple and fast. But unlike digital signatures, they don't verify the identity of the person signing.

Digital signatures, on the other hand, are a step up. They use certificate-based digital IDs to ensure the documentâ€™s integrity. This type of signature involves cryptographic operations, handled by Certificate Authorities (CAs) or Trust Service Providers (TSPs), to verify both the document and the signer's identity. Digital signatures follow a secure process using public key infrastructure (PKI), making them more trustworthy. They provide proof of who signed the document and that it's authentic and unchanged.

CobbleStone Software notes that upgrading to digital signatures can boost security, compliance, and acceptance of signatures. Regulations like the eIDAS and other international laws might even require their use. CobbleStone's partnership with Global Sign ensures their digital signatures are on the Adobe Approved Trust List (AATL) and the European Union Trusted Lists (EUTL), making them widely recognized and reliable.

Digital signatures are likened to notarized signatures in the digital world. They save resources and time, offering a transparent and efficient system for managing contracts and signatures. Organizations can enjoy increased savings by using these tools to streamline document workflows and ensure they meet various regulatory demands. CobbleStone Software encourages users to explore contract lifecycle management software to further harness these digital tools.
