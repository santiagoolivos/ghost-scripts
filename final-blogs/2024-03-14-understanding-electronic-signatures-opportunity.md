A [recent article by DSM Avocats à la Cour](https://www.dsm.legal/fr/comprendre-la-signature-electronique/) highlights how electronic signatures are transforming digital transactions. The piece explains electronic signatures, which allow people to sign documents online while ensuring security and authenticity. This is possible by using encryption tools, like PIN codes or fingerprint scans, to verify the signer's identity. The article notes that under Article 1322-1 of the Civil Code, these signatures must ensure document integrity and signer's consent to be legally valid.

The article discusses various types of electronic signatures set under the European regulation eIDAS, which stands for electronic Identification and Trust Services Regulation. The simplest type, a Simple Electronic Signature (SES), involves actions like ticking a box online. It's quick but doesn't confirm the signer's identity. It's suitable for less sensitive tasks. There's also the Advanced Electronic Signature (AES), requiring a higher degree of identity verification, such as showing an ID or using a unique code. However, both SES and AES don't hold the same legal weight as a handwritten signature.

The highest security level is the Qualified Electronic Signature (QES). This type must be verified by a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP), giving it equal legal power to handwritten signatures. It's recommended for important contracts.

The article also discusses the Law of July 7, 2023, on Electronic Authentic Act, expanding the use of QES for official documents like deeds, except for wills. This option is now available for notaries, though optional.

DSM Avocats à la Cour emphasizes the importance of understanding electronic signatures to ensure secure digital transactions. Proper use can simplify signing processes and secure legal affairs, marking a positive trend in digital transformation.
