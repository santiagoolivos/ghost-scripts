In a [recent article by DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/2021/12/new-law-on-electronic-document-workflow-in-russia), a new law in Russia aims to modernize employment relations through electronic document workflow, effective November 22, 2021. This change updates the Russian Labour Code and builds on prior experiments that allowed only select employers to maintain HR documents electronically. The new Electronic Workflow Law enables broader use, bringing Russian labor practices closer to current global standards.

Under this law, employers, employees, and job candidates can now manage most HR documents electronically, eliminating the need for paper copies. This digital approach makes it easier to draft, sign, and maintain documents. However, some documents like dismissal orders and labor safety related materials must remain in paper form for now.

The Russian government facilitates this transition with its "Work in Russia" digital platform, which is free for employers to use. Alternatively, companies can develop their own systems, although this may involve extra costs. Employers must prepare internal policies, including the types of electronic signatures allowed. Qualified electronic signatures are required for important documents such as employment agreements, while other documents may use less stringent types.

This law also allows for electronic document workflow in emergency situations, like natural disasters, without requiring employee consent. This flexibility ensures business continuity in crises.

While most of the new regulations are already in force, full integration with the government platform, "Gosuslugi," and specific requirements for electronic document content and format will phase in by 2023.

Overall, the Electronic Workflow Law signifies a positive step in digitizing employment processes in Russia, aiming for a more efficient and accessible way of handling workplace documentation.
