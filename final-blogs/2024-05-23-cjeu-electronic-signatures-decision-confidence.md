A [recent article by Filip & Company](https://filipandcompany.com/cjeu-clarifies-the-probative-value-of-electronic-signatures/) outlines a key decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) that clarifies the importance of electronic signatures in legal proceedings across Europe. The CJEU faced questions about the probative value, or the ability to prove something in court, of these electronic signatures, especially "qualified electronic signatures," which are signatures that meet specific EU security standards.

The CJEU emphasized that electronic signatures shouldn't be dismissed in court just because they aren't handwritten. They confirmed that the Regulation no. 910/2014 requires treating qualified electronic signatures as equal to holographic (handwritten) ones. However, each country's national law can still define how these signatures work legally.

This decision stemmed from a tax dispute in a European Union member state. The issue was whether certain electronic documents were legally signed using qualified electronic signatures. The CJEU's ruling helps align EU-wide rules with national laws, ensuring that electronic signatures have the same legal weight as traditional signatures.

The article by Filip & Company highlights this ruling as an important step in supporting electronic signatures, especially in our increasingly digital world. By setting a clear legal framework, the CJEU decision reassures people and businesses that electronic signatures are reliable and legally binding across EU member states. This promotes smoother and transparent digital transactions, encouraging broader adoption and innovation in digital processes. Overall, the CJEU's clarification fosters optimism about the future of secure and efficient digital interactions.
