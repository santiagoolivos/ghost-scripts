A [recent article by Sotos LLP](https://www.sotosllp.com/2022/09/21/the-legal-validity-of-e-signatures-updates-on-ditching-the-pen/) explains how electronic signatures, or e-signatures, have become legally valid across Canada due to provincial and federal laws, especially in response to the rise in remote work. The article highlights that e-signatures streamline the process of signing documents, making business operations more efficient and accessible.

In Canada, most provinces have adapted the Uniform Electronic Commerce Act, establishing a unified approach to digital commerce. For example, Ontario's Electronic Commerce Act clarifies that e-signatures are as binding as traditional pen-on-paper ones unless a document specifies otherwise. This means people can commonly use e-signatures unless explicitly stated in the contract that only handwritten signatures are acceptable. 

However, certain documents are exceptions to this rule. These include wills, specific trusts, powers of attorney, negotiable instruments, and some documents linked to property titles. These remain governed by their respective laws.

Federally, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) sets guidelines for e-signatures, allowing them in federal legislation as long as they align with PIPEDA's standards. PIPEDA also ensures secure e-signatures that are harder to forge, using technologies like algorithms and blockchain.

The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the acceptance of e-signatures with legislation like the Alternative Filing Methods for Business Act, which allows e-signatures for business documents, making dealings more resilient in turbulent times. The Canada Revenue Agency also began accepting e-signatures for tax documents during the pandemic.

Overall, e-signatures are now a practical and reliable option for signing legal documents across Canada. With advancing digital integration, Canadians can confidently use e-signatures, knowing they are effectively recognized by law.
