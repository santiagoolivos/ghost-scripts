A [recent article by Davis Wright Tremaine LLP](https://www.dwt.com/blogs/employment-labor-and-benefits/2021/06/e-signing-arbitration-agreements#page=1) discusses the challenges and opportunities surrounding the use of electronic signatures (e-signatures) in the context of arbitration agreements, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic. This discussion centers around a California Court of Appeal case, Bannister v. Marinidence OPCO, LLC, where the enforceability of an arbitration agreement signed electronically was questioned.

In this case, Maureen Bannister, a former employee, claimed she did not sign an arbitration agreement, and her employer, Marinidence, could not prove otherwise. The court ruled that Marinidence failed to demonstrate that Bannister's electronic signature was genuine, which made the arbitration agreement unenforceable. This decision underscores the importance of proper verification of e-signatures.

According to California Civil Code section 1633.9(a), an electronic signature can be attributed to a person if it was their act. Verification might involve things like requiring a unique login and password that only the employee knows. However, in the Bannister case, the court found that Marinidence did not sufficiently prove that Bannister herself signed the agreement, despite claiming that the process required her personal information, like a social security number and pin code.

The article suggests that while technology facilitates quicker employee onboarding through e-signatures, it also increases the risk of disputes over the validity of such signatures. Therefore, it's important to ensure that only the right person can sign these documents. Adopting a standalone agreement for e-signature consent or using "wet" signatures (physical signatures) when feasible are strategies that could minimize electronic transaction issues in workplaces.

Overall, the article by Davis Wright Tremaine LLP offers critical insights and practical advice for employers navigating the complexities of electronic signatures during remote onboarding.
