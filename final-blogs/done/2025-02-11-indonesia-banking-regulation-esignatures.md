The [recent article by Assegaf Hamzah & Partners](https://www.ahp.co.id/news-and-insights/indonesias-new-regulation-expands-bank-services) discusses Indonesia's Financial Services Authority (OJK) new regulation. Issued at the end of 2024, [OJK Regulation No. 26 of 2024](https://iru.ojk.go.id/iru/policy/detailpolicy/13317/ojk-issues-regulation-concerning-expansion-of-business-activities-to-boost-banking-growth) gives banks more flexibility in offering services while ensuring they follow sound financial practices. This regulation, effective from December 13, 2024, introduces new opportunities for banks. They can now participate in capital activities, engage in loan sales, offer guarantees, operate foreign exchange services, and use electronic signatures (e-signatures) and agreements.

For capital participation, the regulation allows both conventional and sharia banks to invest beyond the financial sector, expanding their investment opportunities. Sharia banks must still adhere to sharia principles.

On loan sales, the regulation ends any confusion by clearly allowing banks to sell or transfer loans, provided they transfer both ownership and risk to the buyer. Banks must update their loan policies by June 2025 to comply.

In terms of guarantees, the regulation emphasizes thorough evaluation and risk management when banks issue different types of guarantees like letters of credit.

When it comes to foreign exchange, banks can now offer these as new products following standards set by previous OJK regulations. They must ensure the buying and selling rates are market-driven.

Importantly, the regulation recognizes the role of digital innovations. It requires banks to have clear policies for using e-signatures and e-agreements, ensuring they protect consumers and adhere to good financial practices.

Overall, OJK Regulation No. 26 of 2024 marks an important step for Indonesian banks towards innovation and international alignment. It allows for more diverse services, better risk management, and a move towards a digital future. These changes are likely to make banks more competitive and able to support economic growth effectively.
