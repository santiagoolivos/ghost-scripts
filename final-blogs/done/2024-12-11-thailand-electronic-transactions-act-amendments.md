A [recent article by Tilleke & Gibbins](https://www.tilleke.com/insights/thailand-releases-draft-of-amended-electronic-transactions-act/) explains Thailand's release of a draft for the amended [Electronic Transactions Act (ETA)](https://www.etda.or.th/getattachment/8faa736b-3235-49c8-8b01-d37ff53a9a45/ENG-Version.aspx). The proposed changes aim to improve the outdated 2001 law, making it more effective for today's electronic transactions. Thailand invites public comments on the draft until December 20, 2024.

The draft introduces several key updates. First, it embraces both current and future technologies, allowing electronic transactions without needing new regulations every time tech changes. It also replaces the old licensing and registration system for service providers with a new trust-mark system.

The major changes include setting the draft ETA as the main law for electronic transactions, affecting both private dealings and interactions with the state. The draft clarifies definitions, including what counts as a "transaction" and introduces new terms like "biometric data" and "electronic seal."

Reliability in electronic transactions is enhanced. If a method used is deemed reliable by the Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA), the transaction is presumed reliable. If someone disputes this, they must prove otherwise.

The adoption of the [UNCITRAL Model Law](https://uncitral.un.org/sites/uncitral.un.org/files/media-documents/uncitral/en/06-54671_ebook.pdf) means electronic transferable records, like electronic bills of lading, are recognized. For recognition, these records must meet certain criteria, such as containing necessary information and using reliable methods.

For service providers, the draft does away with licensing requirements. Instead, compliance with criteria makes them qualified, and further ETDA certification can be requested. Certified providers gain legal protections, and any issues with reliability can lead to losing these benefits.

Digital platforms aren't directly covered by the new draft, but they remain regulated under existing laws until a forthcoming new law is enacted.

The draft ETA signals Thailand's commitment to improving its digital transaction framework, simplifying processes, and preparing for technological advances.
