A [recent article by Härting Rechtsanwälte](https://haerting.ch/en/insights/eu-anerkennung-elektronische-signatur-nach-schweizer-recht/) sheds light on promising efforts towards the mutual recognition of electronic signatures between Switzerland and the European Union (EU). Currently, Switzerland’s Federal Act on Electronic Signatures [(ZertES)](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/2004/788/de) allows for electronic signatures, but these aren’t officially recognized by the EU. Similarly, [EU's eIDAS](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation) Regulation sets standards for electronic signatures but doesn't recognize Swiss signatures. This lack of mutual recognition leads to practical issues, like needing multiple signatures for cross-border contracts and challenges in legal disputes. Swiss businesses also face hurdles when participating in EU public tenders due to these differing regulations.

The good news is that Switzerland’s Federal Council has directed two departments, DETEC and the FDFA, to create a mandate for negotiations with the EU. This step aims at achieving recognition of [Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES)](https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-03/Instructions%20for%20QES%20signature%20of%20documents.pdf) across both regions. If successful, such an agreement would validate electronic certificates issued in EU countries and Switzerland, facilitating international business and reducing cumbersome paperwork.

The article explains that these ongoing efforts should boost digitalization and lessen bureaucratic barriers. However, challenges remain, particularly in aligning technical requirements, and the outcome of negotiations remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Swiss companies are advised to consider using EU-certified signatures for important deals to avoid potential pitfalls.

Overall, this move towards mutual recognition is anticipated to simplify cross-border transactions and foster a more cooperative digital environment across Switzerland and the EU. Though the adjustments may take time, they represent a significant step forward in international electronic commerce.
