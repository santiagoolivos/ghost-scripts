A [recent article by DLA Piper](https://www.dlapiper.com/en-us/insights/publications/2021/07/with-illinoiss-adoption-of-ueta-united-states-near-full-adoption) discusses Illinois's recent decision to adopt the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA), making it the 49th state in the United States to enforce this law. On June 25, 2021, Governor JB Pritzker signed SB2176, which officially enacted UETA in Illinois. This move repealed the state's previous electronic signature law, the Electronic Commerce Security Act (ECSA), and made necessary changes to align existing state laws with the new UETA standards. This was shortly after Washington adopted its version of UETA in 2020.

At this point, New York is the only state that has not adopted UETA. Instead, it uses the New York Electronic Signatures and Records Act (NYESRA). This law ensures that electronic signatures have the same legal standing as handwritten ones. While NYESRA isn't the same as UETA, New York courts determined that its legislature intended for NYESRA to align with the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act.

Lastly, although almost every state has adopted UETA, not all have the same version. For instance, California has expanded its list of exemptions related to electronic records and signatures. This means that electronic transactions in California require careful consideration, as the state does not apply UETA to all types of transactions unless other specific California laws allow for it.

The adoption of UETA by Illinois marks another significant step towards uniformity in electronic transaction laws across the United States, fostering a streamlined digital environment for businesses and individuals alike.
