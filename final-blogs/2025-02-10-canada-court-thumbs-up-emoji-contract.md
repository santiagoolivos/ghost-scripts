A [recent article by McMillan LLP](https://mcmillan.ca/insights/publications/thumbs-up-or-signed-deal-court-affirms-emoji-as-valid-acceptance-of-agreement/) discusses a significant legal development in Canada where a court ruled that a "thumbs-up" emoji in a text message can be a valid form of accepting a contract. The case involved South West Terminal Ltd. and Achter Land, where the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal upheld a previous decision, stating that the emoji satisfied the signature requirements under the Sale of Goods Act, RSS 1978, c S-1. 

The court examined whether this emoji indicated an intention to agree, considering the parties' commercial communication history. The emoji was seen as part of the modern communication landscape, yet it didn't change the contract law basics. The decision stresses that interpretation depends on context, highlighting that emoji use can be subtle and ambiguous.

The court also addressed the terms of the contract, pointing out that an oversight like omitting the delivery year didn't void the agreement, as prior verbal agreements had established the intended terms. The court further examined the role of electronic law, particularly focusing on whether the emoji met the "electronic signature" criteria under the Electronic Information and Documents Act.

The ruling emphasizes that modern forms of communication don't negate the legal obligations of contracts. If an emoji is part of the conversation, as in this case, and meets legal standards, it can represent a legitimate contract agreement. This insight is crucial as it highlights how courts strive to interpret technological advances within existing legal frameworks.

Such rulings illustrate the evolving nature of communication and the need for parties to understand that even informal signals like emojis can carry legal weight. It's a reminder that courts aim to ensure fairness and consistency in electronic communications, treating them with the same seriousness as traditional paper documents.
