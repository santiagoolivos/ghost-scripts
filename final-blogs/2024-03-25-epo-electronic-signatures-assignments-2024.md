A [recent article by Berggren Oy](https://www.berggren.eu/en/blog/electronic-and-digital-signatures-on-assignments-and-declarations-to-be-accepted-by-the-epo-from-1-april) shares exciting news about the European Patent Office (EPO) starting April 1, 2024. Electronic and digital signatures will be accepted on assignments and declarations. This marks a significant change from the past when only paper signatures were allowed. Electronic signatures include simple text-based ones, like typing your name in a specific format, while digital signatures involve using services like DocuSign.

This change by the EPO aims to make processes more efficient and modern. Electronic signatures will simplify filing contracts and declarations for registering assignments or licenses. Although digital signatures have a few basic rules, they are not difficult to follow. Documents must be electronically filed, easy to read, virus-free, and secure from harmful software. 

To meet these criteria smoothly, it's a good idea to use text-based signatures alongside digital ones. This aligns with EPOâ€™s guidelines and ensures the signatures are valid. However, some requirements remain unchanged, like getting both parties to sign an assignment.

The article by Berggren Oy brings a positive outlook on the future. Accepting electronic signatures by the EPO is a step forward in digital transformation. It promises easier, faster, and more environmentally friendly processes for all involved.
