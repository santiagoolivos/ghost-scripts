Title: Taiwan Strengthens its Electronic Signatures Act for the Digital Age
Excerpt: Taiwan's proposed amendments aim to modernize the Electronic Signatures Act, according to Lee Tsai & Partners.

A recent article by Lee Tsai & Partners reveals exciting updates to Taiwan's Electronic Signatures Act. After more than 20 years with no changes, the Ministry of Digital Affairs (MODA) has introduced draft amendments to align with the digital shift and promote electronic documents and signatures. 

These amendments clarify what a digital signature is and affirm its role as a type of electronic signature. A digital signature must not only fit the electronic signature definition but also use private and public key encryption safely, with a valid certificate from an authority.

The draft also asserts that electronic documents and signatures are as trustworthy as their paper counterparts. Even though disputes about signing authenticity will still require proof, a digital signature gets the benefit of doubt, assumed to be authentic.

Further, the draft opens more possibilities for using electronic forms, now including the legal backing without needing another personâ€™s agreement, unless an alternative method is offered.

A big change is that government offices cannot create barriers to using electronic signatures by just issuing rules. They need to update and review any exceptions they have made in the past, and gradually repeal them within three years of the amendment coming into effect.

These thoughtful adjustments to the law are structured to embrace technology better in government and commerce. By simplifying how electronic signatures can be used, Taiwan is paving the way for easier digital transactions, showing impressive progress and a commitment to future-ready governance.
