A [recent article by Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co](https://www.amsshardul.com/insight/modernizing-e-signature-laws-in-india/) highlights the need to update India's e-signature laws under the Information Technology Act, 2000. With India rapidly moving towards a digital economy, this update could help boost electronic transactions and strengthen the digital framework. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology is working on the Digital India Act (DIA), which offers a chance to modernize legal structures for e-signatures.

E-signatures are already recognized in India but face limitations regarding certain types of documents like promissory notes, trusts, and wills. The proposed changes suggest including more documents under e-signature capabilities, making it easier for businesses to go paperless and saving time and resources.

The article recommends clearer definitions for different types of e-signatures, much like the systems used in the UK. This would differentiate basic e-signatures, advanced types, and those similar to handwritten signatures. Such clarity could encourage broader adoption of e-signatures across various sectors in India.

Additionally, the firm suggests improving security for digital signatures and creating a centralized system to safely track their use. Keeping security updated can prevent fraud and build trust in digital transactions.

Finally, the piece argues for consolidating the existing fragmented rules regarding e-signatures into one clear law under the DIA. This consolidation would make it easier for everyone, from businesses to individuals, to understand and use e-signatures legally and efficiently.

By taking these steps, India could significantly enhance its digital economy, facilitating more online business transactions and helping to achieve its goal of becoming a USD 1 trillion digital economy. The changes would align India's e-signature laws with international standards, promoting not just innovation but also economic growth.
