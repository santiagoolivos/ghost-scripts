Title: Exploring the Growing Use of Electronic Signatures in Hong Kong
Excerpt: Discover how Hauzen delves into Hong Kong's evolving acceptance of electronic signatures in business and litigation.

A recent article by Hauzen discusses the growing use of electronic signatures in Hong Kong, a practice recognized under the Electronic Transactions Ordinance (ETO) since January 2000. With COVID-19 reshaping how businesses operate, electronic signatures are becoming increasingly popular, especially in legal and commercial contexts.

The ETO differentiates between Electronic Signatures and Digital Signatures, both part of what is called E-Signatures. While Electronic Signatures are simple symbols linking to digital records, Digital Signatures are more complex. Electronic Signatures, meeting ETO criteria, are valid and enforceable, like traditional signatures, for non-government transactions. They must be linked to digital messages to show approval, use reliable methods, and be agreed upon by the message recipient. Digital Signatures are necessary for government-related dealings, requiring support by a recognized certificate.

Despite their utility, some documents still need traditional signatures according to the law, like wills or real estate documents, and Electronic Signatures are not yet accepted in court proceedings. However, this might change with the Court Proceedings (Electronic Technology) Bill, hinting at an electronic future for court filings once it becomes law.

The article encourages considering ETO rules when using electronic signatures, especially for international deals where laws may differ. It's also important to ensure signatures identify the right person, and any agreement using these should explicitly state E-signature rules. This practice promotes a modern approach to signing documents while keeping legal protocols intact. Hauzen's insights highlight the positive shift toward electronic processes in Hong Kong, pointing toward a future where digital documentation becomes more integrated into daily business.
