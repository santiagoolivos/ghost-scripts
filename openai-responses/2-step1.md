A recent article by The Legal Co. discusses new guidelines from Thailand’s Electronic Transactions Development Agency (ETDA) about electronic contracts, or e-Contracts. These guidelines make electronic transactions easier and safer by providing a step-by-step framework for creating, maintaining, and converting e-contracts. This can help businesses and individuals by using technology effectively in everyday transactions.

The guidelines break down e-Contract management into three key phases. First, when creating e-Contracts, users can draft these using simple software like Word or Google Docs. An electronic signature must clearly identify the person signing and show their approval. Unique features like electronic seals add extra security and validate the e-Contract’s origin. Paying stamp duty, if needed, can be done electronically.

The second phase focuses on maintaining e-Contracts. It’s important to keep them accessible and unchanged in terms of content, although changes in formatting might be okay. It is also crucial to log events, like when the contract is sent or received.

Finally, in the conversion phase, e-Contracts can be turned into printouts and vice versa. Both forms should accurately reflect content and format to ensure trustworthiness.

These guidelines encourage using technology for safer transactions and emphasize the security of electronic signatures and seals. By following these guidelines, businesses and individuals will enhance the reliability and legal standing of their e-Contracts.

Overall, the new ETDA guidelines by The Legal Co. highlight the importance of adapting to technological changes, which are becoming essential for efficient and secure electronic transactions.
