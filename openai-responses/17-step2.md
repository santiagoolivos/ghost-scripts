A [recent article by Formichella & Sritawat Attorneys at Law](https://fosrlaw.com/2023/04/04/) discusses the exciting developments in Thailand's e-commerce market, placing a spotlight on the use of electronic signatures (e-signatures). As Thailand's online shopping sector is set to reach $11 billion by 2025, e-signatures play a crucial role in facilitating smooth digital transactions. In 2017, the country's e-commerce market was valued at $2 billion, with an expected increase to $3.5 billion by 2018. The growth is fueled by better internet access, more mobile phone users, and improved payment systems.

E-signatures are vital because they help finalize transactions easily and securely, improving trust between parties. In Thai law, an e-signature can be any digital symbol that links the signer to the electronic data they approve. This means that e-signatures are legally binding and enforceable in Thailand.

To be considered trustworthy, an e-signature must be unique to its owner and under their exclusive control. It should also be able to show if any changes are made to the signature or the signed document. Technologies like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) make e-signatures secure and acceptable under Thai law. This reliability makes them a key part of modern business in the digital age.

Overall, this development signals a bright future for e-commerce in Thailand and supports a thriving digital economy. Adopting e-signatures creates a safer, more efficient online shopping environment that benefits both businesses and consumers.
