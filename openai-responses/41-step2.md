[A recent article by Samano Abogados SC](https://www.samanosc.com.mx/post/reforma-a-la-ley-del-notariado-para-la-ciudad-de-m%C3%A9xico-para-gestiones-por-medios-electr%C3%B3nicos) discusses transformative changes to the Law of Notaries for Mexico City, enabling notarial procedures through electronic means. This reform addresses challenges brought by the pandemic, which hindered face-to-face notarial tasks due to health risks and restrictions. As people faced difficulties in accessing in-person services necessary for legal processes, the reform aims to remove barriers by allowing digital alternatives.

One significant change is the recognition of electronic notarial instruments, meaning digital documents will hold the same legal power as traditional paper ones. This capability is ensured by using an advanced electronic signature, specifically tailored for Mexico City, which all notaries must keep up to date. Additionally, notaries will use a digital notary signature, enabling them to conduct business remotely using a special Informatic System, a secure digital platform designed for such purposes.

Moreover, the reform introduces the use of data messages for creating and conveying notarial documents, supporting the validity and authenticity of digital over physical files. A new network fosters cooperation among notaries, the College of Notaries, and public authorities to boost digital technology's effectiveness in notarial procedures.

This digital shift will become official two years after its announcement, requiring infrastructure updates for notaries to operate securely and legally online. While the full digital notarization implementation may take time, the reform marks a huge step toward the future of legal services, offering flexibility and enhancing legal security in uncertain times.

Ultimately, this reform is a forward-thinking measure, adapting traditional legal practices to contemporary needs by embracing digitalization and ensuring continued access to essential legal services in Mexico City, even in challenging circumstances.
