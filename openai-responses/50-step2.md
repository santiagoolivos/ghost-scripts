A [recent article by Jones Day](https://www.jonesday.com/en/insights/2021/02/singapores-electronic-transactions-act-expanded) explains how Singapore's new electronic transactions law is evolving to include more digital documents. On February 1, 2021, Singapore's Parliament passed the Electronic Transactions (Amendment) Bill, which allows electronic versions of official trade documents, called Electronic Transferable Records (ETRs), to be legally recognized. This change is part of a bigger plan to support digital business operations, which have become essential during the COVID-19 pandemic when face-to-face meetings are not easy.

Since 1998, electronic records and signatures had legal backing in Singapore due to the Electronic Transactions Act (ETA), but not for certain documents like Transferable Instruments, which include important trade papers such as bills of exchange and promissory notes. The new Bill integrates standards from the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law's Model Law on ETRs, positioning Singapore as a leading adopter among global trade hubs. Under the amended rules, these digital documents must meet specific criteria to ensure they are secure and unchanged (except for normal updates like data storage), as long as they are part of a reliable system.

Moreover, electronic signatures on these documents will legally suffice, ensuring that businesses can operate efficiently and flexibly. The amendments also facilitate the use of flexible technologies like tokens and ledgers, allowing businesses to fully realize the benefits of going digital. Importantly, firms in fields such as maritime trade and international finance can expect cost savings and quicker turnaround times.

In conclusion, the enhancements to the ETA signify a positive shift towards digital trade solutions, encouraging companies to update their business and digital systems to harness these new opportunities, as noted by Jones Day.
