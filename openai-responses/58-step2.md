A [recent article by Brodies LLP](https://brodies.com/insights/corporate/how-to-sell-a-company-part-6-signing-the-transaction-documents/#page=1) highlights the increasingly crucial role of electronic signatures in the process of selling a company. The piece is part six of a series focused on the steps involved in a company sale and dives into the specifics of signing transaction documents. It explains how closing deals can be an exciting phase for both buyers and sellers but emphasizes the importance of correctly executing signing procedures to ensure the transaction's validity under the law applicable to the deal.

A major highlight of the article is how the choice of governing law, whether Scots or English, affects the signing requirements of transaction documents. Differences in legal requirements can impact whether individuals need to sign as natural persons or as representatives of companies. For instance, under Scots law, a document can be signed by one person for formal validity but needs two signatures to be probative, meaning legally reliable. Similarly, English law distinguishes between simple contracts and more formal deeds.

The article also delves into the transition from traditional "wet ink" signing to electronic signatures, which are now common and convenient thanks to platforms like DocuSign. Not only do electronic signatures speed up the process by accommodating busy schedules, but they also offer environmental benefits by reducing paper use.

There are several types of electronic signatures recognized by Scots and English law, each with varying levels of security and reliability. However, there are differences in the witnessing of electronic signatures: Scots law does not allow electronic witnessing, whereas English law does, provided the witness is physically present during signing.

The article underscores the benefit of electronic signing in making the transaction process smoother and more efficient for all parties involved, setting a positive tone for the future of digital transactions.
