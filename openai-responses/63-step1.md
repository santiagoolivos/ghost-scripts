A recent article by DLA Piper highlights the importance of digital transformation for businesses and offers ten useful practices to navigate its legal risks. Digital transformation is key for companies aiming to stay relevant in today's fast-paced digital world. However, it also presents challenges, especially regarding legal compliance.

First, the article emphasizes the need to keep up with online regulations. Staying informed about laws, like the Electronic Signatures and National Commerce Act (ESIGN), helps avoid legal issues. Businesses should also comply with data privacy laws, such as the GDPR and the California Consumer Privacy Act, ensuring they protect customer data effectively.

Protecting intellectual property is another crucial step. Companies should secure their trademarks, copyrights, and patents while safeguarding trade secrets through confidentiality agreements. Licensing digital content correctly is also important, especially when using images, videos, and music.

If a company engages in e-commerce, it must consider consumer protection laws to ensure fair practices. This might include being clear about prices, taxes, and refund policies. Labor laws matter, too, as digital changes affect employment practices like remote work and data protection for employees.

Accessibility is critical; digital tools should be inclusive, complying with laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. Reviewing contracts is vital, especially with changes from digital upgrades. This ensures all parties understand issues like data use and digital asset ownership.

A strong cybersecurity plan is essential. Regularly checking for vulnerabilities and having a clear response plan for breaches can mitigate risks. Finally, consulting with legal experts who specialize in technology can provide valuable guidance, ensuring that businesses meet legal obligations.

This article by DLA Piper provides a comprehensive roadmap for companies on their digital transformation journey, emphasizing the importance of foresight and legal awareness.
