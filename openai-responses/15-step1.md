A recent article by Dentons shares an exciting legal development in Canada: the court has accepted a thumbs-up emoji as a valid electronic signature. This case involves South West Terminal Ltd. (SWT) and Achter Land & Cattle Ltd. (Achter) over an agreement to sell 87 metric tonnes of flax at a set price. When Achter failed to deliver, SWT sued for breach of contract. Achter argued the absence of a formal agreement signed by both parties rendered the contract unenforceable under The Sale of Goods Act.

The case hinged on whether a thumbs-up emoji, sent by Achter in response to a request to confirm the contract, met the legal requirements for an electronic signature. The court used the Electronic Information and Documents Act, 2000 (EIDA) to interpret the emoji as a valid electronic signature. EIDA defines electronic signatures as information in electronic form that someone uses to sign a document, confirming that emojis can meet this requirement if they show the user's clear acceptance of a contract.

The court ruled that Achter's emoji fulfilled the requirement for a "signature" under the law, given the parties' previous dealings and how they conducted their agreements via text messages. This ruling emphasizes the importance of context in understanding digital communications and marks a significant step forward in adapting traditional contract law to modern communication methods.

The outcome was a judgment in SWT's favor, with damages of $82,200.21 awarded against Achter. This case could pave the way for more innovative uses of digital communication in legal agreements, highlighting the dynamic potential of electronic signatures in global commerce.
