Title: Understanding Electronic Signatures in Panama: A Legal Overview
Excerpt: A recent article by Arias explains Panama's electronic signature laws, highlighting their potential to streamline business processes.

A recent article by Arias explores the world of electronic signatures in Panama, emphasizing their impact on business efficiency. In Panama, electronic signatures have been legally recognized for 15 years. However, some companies and public institutions remain unsure about using this method, which aims to simplify business operations. The article seeks to clarify the laws governing electronic signatures to encourage wider adoption in business activities.

Panama’s main legal framework for electronic signatures consists of Law 51/2008, modified by Law 82/2012, and Executive Decree 684/2013. These regulations cover electronic documents, electronic signatures, and services related to storing and certifying these signatures. An electronic signature is a way to identify a person and show that they approve of the information in an electronic document. There are different types of signatures, such as simple electronic signatures and qualified electronic signatures.

A simple electronic signature helps identify a person but doesn’t carry the legal certainty of a qualified electronic signature. A qualified electronic signature has more security because it is backed by a certified electronic document. This certification confirms the identity of the signer and verifies the signature's authenticity and integrity. A qualified electronic signature is more reliable because it prevents the document from being altered and ensures the signer cannot deny the document later.

The article highlights that qualified electronic certificates are valid for two years and can be renewed. To obtain these certificates, individuals and companies need to meet various requirements and pay certain fees. The Dirección Nacional de Firma Electrónica (National Electronic Signature Directorate) is responsible for managing electronic certificates in Panama.

According to the article, electronic signatures have legal value under Law 51/2008 if they meet certain conditions, such as doing a reliable job of identifying the signer and ensuring the content is accurate. For public sector use, institutions may require more specific types of signatures. Although the law supports electronic signatures in government activities, not all entities have implemented them, leaving the choice of signature type up to the specific agency.
