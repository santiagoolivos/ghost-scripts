Title: Electronic Signing Becomes Permanent in Queensland
Excerpt: New legislation in Queensland makes electronic signing permanent, as reported by Colin Biggers & Paisley Lawyers.

Recent article by Colin Biggers & Paisley Lawyers explains that Queensland has made electronic signing of documents a permanent part of its legal process. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Queensland had temporary rules to allow electronic signatures. Now, these rules are permanent thanks to the Justice and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2021.

This change means people don't have to sign many documents in person anymore. This makes things faster and easier. It's similar to what New South Wales and Victoria have done. Queensland's new law updates the Property Law Act 1974 (Qld), Oaths Act 1867 (Qld), and Powers of Attorney Act 1998 (Qld). Now, people can sign deeds, affidavits, and other documents electronically.

The law also lets corporations sign deeds without a seal or witness by videoconference. For affidavits and similar documents, people can be witnesses remotely, using a signed copy or true counterpart.

An electronic signature must identify the person who signs and show they intend to sign. It should be reliable for the circumstances, and all parties must agree to this form of signing. The government may provide more advice on acceptable signing methods.

Colin Biggers & Paisley Lawyers use different apps to help sign documents, like CBP Exchange for real estate contracts and CBP Lease Manager for updating clients on leases. These tools make managing properties and leases smoother for their clients.

In conclusion, Queensland's new permanent rules for electronic signing can boost efficiency, making life's paperwork a bit simpler.
