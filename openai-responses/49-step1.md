Title: Enhancements Suggested for Jersey and Guernsey E-Signature Laws
Excerpt: Walkers discusses potential updates to Jersey and Guernsey's e-signature laws, focusing on validity and remote witnessing.

A recent article by Walkers highlights the growing importance of electronic signatures in Jersey and Guernsey. The COVID-19 pandemic has sped up the shift from traditional paper-based processes to electronic signing. This change has mostly been smooth because of existing laws like the Electronic Communications (Jersey) Law 2000 and the Electronic Transactions (Guernsey) Law, 2000. These laws support forming contracts electronically through various methods like email exchanges or using e-signature apps such as DocuSign.

However, Walkers points out that there are areas where these laws need updates. In Jersey, there is a need for clearer rules around remote witnessing of signatures. Currently, the law assumes that witnessing must happen in person unless there are special provisions like those temporarily allowed for wills during the pandemic. Also, they see room for clarification regarding the authority one person has to attach another's e-signature on documents.

Guernsey faces different challenges with its law that excludes the electronic handling of powers of attorney. Though powers of attorney from companies can sometimes be electronically signed under customary law, the legal wording causes confusion. This confusion could affect businesses, especially where documents like fund agreements involve powers of attorney.

The article underscores the potential improvements in e-signature laws, especially for businesses to capitalize on the technology's fraud prevention capabilities. Walkers encourages keeping business documents and practices adaptable for electronic methods, highlighting this as future-proofing for the post-pandemic era. 

Overall, while current laws in both regions are robust, there's optimism that more precise and updated legal guidance will further streamline electronic dealings.
