Title: FDA's New Guidance on Electronic Records in Clinical Trials
Excerpt: Explore FDA's finalized guidance on electronic records and signatures, highlighted in a recent article by Cooley LLP.

A recent article by Cooley LLP outlines the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) new guidance on using electronic records and signatures in clinical trials. The FDA's guidance is aimed at helping sponsors, clinical investigators, and other stakeholders navigate compliance with today's digital standards. It's an exciting development that embraces the digital transition and aims to ensure transparency and traceability of data. This final guidance includes 29 key questions related to electronic records and various systems involved in the clinical process, along with insights on using digital health technologies (DHTs).

The article traces the history of FDA's Part 11 regulations, which began in 1997. Recent updates now address the technological advancements up to 2024, notably those accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which pushed many to adopt remote technologies for clinical trials. Big changes include clarifying how real-world data from electronic health records should be handled and how records need to be managed whether involving trials in the U.S. or internationally.

Thereâ€™s a focus on making sure electronic systems used in clinical trials are validated and safe. Systems need to be documented, showing their use and safeguards, like who can access them and how to maintain data integrity. The FDA expects sponsors to ensure every record is accurate and retrievable during compliance checks.

Digital health technologies have a special mention, as trials increasingly rely on these tools to collect data efficiently. The article underlines the importance of securely transferring data into an electronic repository and having audit trails to track changes. Although artificial intelligence's role remains unclear in the current guidelines, the article notes that AI tools have started assisting with compliance, and further clarity might come in the future.

This new FDA guidance brings optimism and clarity to those involved in clinical trials worldwide, aiming for consistency in how electronic records and signatures are managed securely and transparently.
