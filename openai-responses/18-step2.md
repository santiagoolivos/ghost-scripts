This law explains that electronic signatures help verify identities, and it outlines the difference between simple and secure electronic signatures. A secure electronic signature is equivalent to a handwritten one, providing strong evidence in legal matters. In contrast, a simple electronic signature is only considered as initial proof.

In the context of employment relationships, electronic signatures offer practical advantages for both employers and employees, although their use is not mandatory by law. The Turkish Code of Obligations allows employers to require employees to use electronic signatures for various tasks. This flexibility can simplify processes and enhance efficiency regarding payrolls and leave records. Notably, some court decisions in Turkey have accepted electronic records as evidence, recognizing their potential to replace traditional paper documentation in some cases.

However, there are specific situations where electronic signatures cannot substitute handwritten ones. For certain legal documents, such as significant changes in working conditions and personal data consent forms, a wet signature remains necessary. These documents require a handwritten signature to be valid under Turkish law. Despite these exceptions, the potential for digitalizations in Turkey’s employment sector remains optimistic.

This focus on modernizing employment practices represents a positive step toward integrating more technology-friendly approaches in the workplace. Legal acknowledgment and implementation of electronic signature practices could lead to broader adoption and improvements in efficiency and convenience across different sectors.
